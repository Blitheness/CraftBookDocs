Requirements
============

CraftBook requires a version of the Minecraft server that supports the `Bukkit API <https://spigotmc.org/>`_, which includes `PaperMC <https://papermc.io>`_ and Spigot. The official Minecraft server is not supported. The "vanilla" Minecraft server cannot run plugins. Other server implementations, such as Forge, are also not supported by CraftBook.

.. note::

     A now discontinued version of CraftBook is available that supports the `Sponge API <https://spongepowered.org/>`_, it can be found `here <https://ore.spongepowered.org/enginehub/CraftBook/>`_.

Installation
============

CraftBook can be `downloaded from the Bukkit dev site <http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/craftbook/>`_.

1. In your server folder, create a "plugins" folder if one does not yet exist.
2. Copy the CraftBook .jar file into the plugins folder. (Make sure you get WorldEdit as well!)
3. Start your server.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`support` page.
