**MC3030** is an IC that implements an RS-Nor latch (Commonly called an SR-Nor Latch). Only the Q output is available.

When the S ("set") input exclusively goes high, the output (Q) goes high and stays high even if S goes low again. When the R ("reset") input
exclusively goes high, the output (Q) goes low and stays low even if R goes low again.

If both go high at the same time, the output goes low. If both go low at the same time, the output does not change.
