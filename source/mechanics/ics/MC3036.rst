MC3036
======

**MC3036** is an IC that implements a flip flop that sets its output to the state of the D ("data") input whenever the clock input is high. If the D
input changes state while the clock is low, the output will not change. Also, while the reset input is high the output state is forced to low.

Equivalent Perlstone script: ``C[-dSp0r]A[BdSp0r]Lp0r``
