Hidden Switch
=============

Hidden Switches allow you to hide a redstone lever or button behind a wall. On right click of the associated block, the lever or button will toggle.

Construction
============

Hidden switches consist of three parts:

# A block to put the sign on.
# Either a sign post or a wall sign with **[X]** as the second line.
# A lever or button one block away from the sign in any right angle direction.

Right clicking a block next to the sign will toggle the switch(es) or button(s) adjacent to the sign.
