Chairs
======

The Chairs mechanic allows players to sit on blocks, such as stair blocks.

Construction
============

A chair is any block that is listed in the configuration, usually stair blocks. There must be a block underneath the chair block for it to count.

Sign Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to require signs to be attached to the chairs in the config. When this is enabled, a sign block must be attached to the chair in
some regard. If this is a long chair, only a single sign is required on the whole structure.

Usage
=====

Right click a block that is defined as a chair to sit on it. A message will be shown if there is no block beneath the chair, and the player will not be allowed to sit.

Healing
~~~~~~~

If enabled in the config, it is possible to have chairs slowly heal the player at a configurable rate. The player's exhaustion level is also
lowered, regardless of the config setting.
