Variables
=========

'Variables' is a mechanic that allows for full dynamic circuits and mechanics. Variables are at the core of CraftBook, and are considered one of the
most powerful features that allow for incredible things to be done.

Usage
=====

A variable is basically a key->value type store that allows for a value to be assigned to a line of text.
This allows for mechanics and other systems to reference a dynamic value that can be changed without recreating the mechanic.
