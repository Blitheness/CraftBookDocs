Better Physics
==============

Better Physics is a series of mechanics that aim to allow small changes to physics that make a big difference.

Falling Ladders
===============

Falling ladders allow a player to place ladders at the top of a hole, and let them fall down creating a safe way down.
Then when they reach the bottom, he/she can break the ladders and have them fall down one at a time, allowing easy breaking.
