Painting Switcher
=================

The Painting Switch mechanic allows a player to switch between paintings using the scroll wheel of their mouse.

Usage
=====

Right click on a painting in a region you are allowed to build in. Use the scroll wheel to find a painting, and then once you've got the right
painting right click again.

Scrolling forward will switch to the next painting, whilst scrolling backwards will scroll to the prior painting.

Mod Paintings
=============

To use paintings added by mods, the mod needs to register the painting with the Registry. If this is done, the painting will work just like a
vanilla painting.
