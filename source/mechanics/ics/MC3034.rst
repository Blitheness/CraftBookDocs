MC3034
======

**MC3034** is an IC that implements a flip flop that sets its output to the state of the D ("data") input whenever the clock input goes from low to
high.

If the D input changes state without the clock going from low to high, the output will not change. If the D input changes while the clock is high,
the output will not change. Also, while the reset input is high the output state is forced to low.

Equivalent Perlstone script: ``C[-dSp0r]Lp1AdSp1.0100[BdSp0r]Lp0r``
