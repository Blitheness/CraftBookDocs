Requirements
============

CraftBook requires a version of the Minecraft server that supports the `SpongeAPI <http://www.spongepowered.org/>`_, which includes SpongeForge, and SpongeVanilla. The official Minecraft server is not supported.

.. note::
    Legacy versions of CraftBook are available that support the `Spigot API <http://spigotmc.org/>`_, they can be found `here <http://ci.md-5.net/job/CraftBook/>`_.

Installation
============

CraftBook can be `downloaded from the EngineHub site <http://builds.enginehub.org/job/craftbook/>`_.

1. If you downloaded CraftBook as a ZIP file, extract it to find "CraftBook.jar" inside. Otherwise, you should already have a .jar file.
2. In your server folder, create a "mods" folder if one does not yet exist.
3. Copy the CraftBook .jar file into the mods folder.
4. Start your server.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`troubleshooting <troubleshooting/index>` page.
