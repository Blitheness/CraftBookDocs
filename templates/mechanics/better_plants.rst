Better Plants
=============

Better Plants is a series of mechanics that aim to enhance the way plants are interacted with in the game. This is to create a more natural environment.

Fern Farming
============

Fern Farming allows for ferns to be farmed. Small ferns grow into large ferns after a period of time, and then the top block of the large fern is breakable to drop another small fern.
Once a large fern is broken, a small fern is put in the place of the large fern.
