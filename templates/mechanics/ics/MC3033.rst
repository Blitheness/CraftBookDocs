**MC3033** is an IC that implements an RS-Nand latch (Commonly called an SR-Nand Latch). Only the Q output is available.

When the S|_| (inverse "set") input exclusively goes high, the output (Q) goes high and stays high even if S|_| goes low again. When the R|_|
(inverse "reset") input exclusively goes high, the output (Q) goes low and stays low even if R|_| goes low again. If both go low at the same time, the
 output goes high.

If both go high at the same time, the output does not change.
