Messenger
=========

The messenger will print a message to the player as they pass over the track. Writing ``\n`` will cause the message to split across multiple lines.

Longer Messages
===============

To send messages longer than can fit on the sign, you can put more signs below the original sign. This can continue until the end of the world,
theoretically.
