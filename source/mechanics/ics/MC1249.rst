   This IC is marked as `Restricted`. This means it's not necessarily suitable for normal players.


**MC1249** is an IC that replaces connected blocks of one type to another depending on on/off state. A configurable delay is waited between changes,
and physics is configurable.

Setting the Blocks
==================

When you first create the IC, two menus will pop up that allow you to enter the 'On State' block, and the 'Off State' block.
