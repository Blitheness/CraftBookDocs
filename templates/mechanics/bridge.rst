Bridge
======

**Bridges** are configurable-width flat sections of the world that you can toggle on and off. The width of the bridge can be changed.

They can be toggled using two different methods:

- Right clicking a sign
- Powering the sign with redstone

Construction
============

Bridges consist of three parts:

- The bridge part made out of one material. The allowed materials are specified in the configuration.
- One sign post on one end, either above or below the bridge. Alternatively, a wall sign can be placed on the side of the block that the sign post would be placed above/below. The second line of the sign must be [Bridge].
- A sign post on the other end, either above or below. Alternatively, a wall sign can be placed on the side of the block that the sign post would be placed above/below. The second line of the sign must be [Bridge] or [Bridge End] (you are only able to right click the first type).

The signs can be both either above or below the bridge (Or on the side of the block), but they must be in the center.
