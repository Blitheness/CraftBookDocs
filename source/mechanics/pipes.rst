Pipes
=====

**Pipes** allow you to quickly transfer items from one place to another.

Construction
============

Pipes consist of numerous parts:

#. An item source. This can be an inventory, a supported CraftBook mechanic, or another supporting plugin or mod.
#. A sticky piston pointed at the source. When the power state of the sticky piston goes from low to high, items are sucked out of the source into
the pipe.
#. A tube of blocks to act as the pipe.
#. A piston pointed at the destination.
#. An item destination. This can be an inventory, a supported CraftBook mechanic, or another supporting plugin or mod.

Tube Types
----------

Different blocks form different functions when used as a tube.

Glass Tubes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Standard glass blocks are simple pipes that pass through all items piped in with no special behaviour. They act as normal pipes.

Stained Glass Tubes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stained glass blocks are used to allow multiple pipes to run next to each other. Stained pipes will only transfer items to standard pipes, or
stained pipes of the same color.
