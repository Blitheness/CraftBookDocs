CraftBook Documentation
=======================

CraftBook is one of Minecraft's first ever game mods, and as a Minecraft SMP addon, it adds:

* Modular, and extremely light on your server. **Everything is off by default.**
* Enable features that you need, disable ones that you don't. Even tweak features to your liking.
* Adds heaps of mechanics that allow you to mimic large portions of FTB/Tekkit with a vanilla client.
* Redstone ICs (Logic gates, Sensors, `Many others! <https://craftbook.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/mechanics/ics/index.html>`_)
* Elevators for your server so people can jump between floors quickly. (Or smoothly, if you choose so)
* Working cauldrons so players can cook inside them.
* Your own custom crafting recipes.
* Hidden switches for players.
* Togglable areas and bridges.
* Chairs you can sit on.
* Working pipes that can transfer items from place to place.
* Footprints where your players walk.
* Mobs and players drop their heads.
* The ability to bind commands to items, with cool-downs, permissions and timers.
* And much more...

Remember that `CraftBook is open source. <https://github.com/EngineHub/CraftBook/tree/3.x>`_
