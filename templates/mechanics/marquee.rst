Marquee
=======

The **Marquee** is a mechanic that outputs the contents of a variable to the player that right clicks it.

Construction
============

To construct a marquee sign, simply put [Marquee] on the second line of a sign.

On the 3rd line of the sign you must enter the name of the variable you wish to display, without any %'s.

If you are using a namespace other than the default for the variable, you must also put that on the 4th line.
