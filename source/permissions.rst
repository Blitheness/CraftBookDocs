Permissions
===========

By default no features of CraftBook can be used, permission nodes need to be assigned in order to provide access to certain features.
This page focuses on general CraftBook permissions, and not those of specific mechanics. For mechanic permissions, see :doc:`mechanics/index`.

You can give the ``craftbook.*`` permission to give yourself and other administrators full access to CraftBook.
