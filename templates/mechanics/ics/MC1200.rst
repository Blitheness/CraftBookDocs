The **MC1200** spawns an entity in the first free space above the block behind the IC sign when the input (the "clock") goes from low to high.

Setting The Entity
==================

The entity to spawn can be set in a few different ways. If you want to simply just spawn a pig, just write the ID of that entity on the 3rd line.
So for a pig you'd write pig (Or minecraft:pig).

If you want to spawn multiple different entities, or entities with more custom data, just leave the 3rd line blank. Once the IC is created it'll
open a menu where you can provide Spawn Eggs of what you want spawned.
