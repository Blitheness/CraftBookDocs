MC1201
======

.. note::

   This IC is marked as `Restricted`. This means it's not necessarily suitable for normal players.


The **MC1201** spawns items in the first free space above the block behind the IC sign when the input (the "clock") goes from low to high.

Setting The Items
=================

The items to spawn can be set in a few different ways. If you want to simply just spawn a stick, just write the ID of that item on the 3rd line.
So for a stick you'd write stick (Or minecraft:stick).

If you want to spawn multiple different items, or items with more custom data, just leave the 3rd line blank. Once the IC is created it'll
open a menu where you can provide all the items you want spawned. This includes amount as well.


Sign Lines

1. DISPENSER
